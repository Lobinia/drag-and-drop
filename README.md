##Description
This is a Drag and Drop project developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, for now it works with the mouse only.

You can freely drag and drop the squares between the areas, as long as it is not already filled with another square.


It has a check procedure after every drag and drop, if you drop the three squares in the bottom areas in the following order: "1 | 2 | 3", the border will change to green, and if you change it afterwards the border will turn white again.
